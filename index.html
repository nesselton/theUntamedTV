                <h2>The Untamed</h2>
                <p> Wei Wuxian, a loathed cultivator of "dark and demonic arts", is resurrected sixteen years after his
                    tragic death. His return to the world brings him to reunite with the people in his first life,
                    including his soulmate, the honoured Lan Wangji. Wei Wuxian begins to remember his time before his
                    demise, from his beginning as a young cultivator using traditional tools like the sword and musical
                    instruments, to his very personal methods of using resentful energy of departed beings, with the
                    help of innovative tools of his own creation.<br><br>
                    The scheming behind his tragic death is slowly unraveled, along with the mysterious death of other
                    people he knew from his past life. ( <a
